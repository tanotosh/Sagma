Project Purpose

What Problems can be solved by Swap by Sagma?
Swap by Sagma sets out to help people who rely on meal prepping due to limited time or a dislike of cooking, but grow tired of eating the same thing repeatedly.

Why was Swap by Sagma made?
This program was made to provide help people who meal prep diversify their meal options by trading meals with other meal preppers.

What does Swap by Sagma do?
This program implements a swipe-based interface, similar to dating apps, to facilitate trading of meal preps. When you’ve prepped a bunch of food but don’t want to eat the same thing for a week, upload information on it and then start swiping! You can filter meals based on what you’re feeling like and your dietary restrictions. If two users like each other's meals, a balanced trade occurs and they get to swap foods and get a diverse blend of cuisines for the week!

Software Features

1. Login/Signup
User decides she wants to join the app so she runs it and creates a profile. She is added as a user to the database. She can leave and log back in to access her information. \[Jiya's story\]

2. Upload Food
User wants to upload the food she made for others to see. She clicks the upload food button on the user home page and is prompted to enter the food's name, ingredients, number of servings, dietary restrictions, type of cuisine, and an image. When she clicks upload food, the program stores the food in the database. \[Gaia's story\]

3. Set Dietary Restrictions
User wants to register her dietary restriction of being dairy free. She clicks on dietary restrictions and is able to select her dietary restrictions. \[Abeera's story\]

4. Search
User now wants to look for other foods. She runs the software and gets a list of possible “matches” for her preferences. Since she is dairy free, the program only shows her dairy free options. She can also decide what category of cuisine she wants, and she will only be shown meals that are that type of cuisine. \[Shannon's story\]

5. Swiping
User is able to swipe on foods that match her specifications. She can decide yes or no. Her swipes are stored in the database and if she gets a match, this is announced. A serving of each food is taken off the market and the other user is notified via email that they got a match. \[Amal's story\]

6. Rating
Later, the user is prompted to leave a rating for the food they tried. They can select between 1 and 5 stars. This rating is added to the User who made that food's rating. \[Gaia's story\]
