Preamble
This program implements a swipe-based interface, similar to dating apps, to facilitate trading of meal preps. When you’ve prepped a bunch of food but don’t want to eat the same thing for a week, upload a picture, description, and list of ingredients and then start swiping! You can filter meals based on what you’re feeling like and your dietary restrictions. If you get a match, you get to swap food and get a diverse blend of cuisines for the week! After you get a meal, you can rate it.

Search
Katie is a university student who prepares one dish every week as a meal prep, she wants to trade her meal with another student with the same intention. She runs the software and gets a list of possible “matches” for her preferences. Since she only eats halal, she only wants to be shown meals that fulfill this dietary restriction. She puts on the filter for that particular dietary restriction, and now is shown and matched exclusively with meals that are halal.
“Start Swiping!”

“You’ve matched!”
Zach swipes right on Cody’s soup and it’s a match! A serving of each of their foods is taken off the market. If this was the last available serving of the food, it’s removed from their profile (added to the past foods) and no longer available in the swiping database. A Match is Displayed and an email is sent to the inactive user, notifying them a match has been made.

Rate Your Food
Giulia recently finished eating a sandwich she got from a swap with Henry. She found it disgusting. She uses the software to leave Henry a low rating that reflects her low opinion of his sandwich
